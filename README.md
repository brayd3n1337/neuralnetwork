Simple neural network solving XOR problems using sigmoid functions.

This was a fun project for me to do to get more familiar with C++ and to enhance my knowledge with neural networks. I will possibly continue this neural network and make it more advanced with more functions.

Currently training the Neural Network with 100,000 epoches but feel free to contribute to this and modify it as you'd like (just please credit me or link original in your readme)!

TODO: Implement other algorithms and increase efficiency.

** some code is bad because it's old i'll update it later.**
