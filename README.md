Simple neural network solving XOR problems using sigmoid functions. Credit to a multitude of sources on the internet :sob: 

This was a fun project for me to do to get more familiar with C++ and to enhance my knowledge with neural networks. I will possibly continue this neural network and make it more advanced with more functions.
